### How it works

The script asks you for your hand using input then generates a random number 1-3, with randint, then procceds  to compare that to your hand to see if you won or lost. Finaly RPS.log, is created or written into, at the location you are running it from, with the result of the game and the details of your hand plus the bots hand.
